    "Counter is a digital device and the output of the counter includes a predefined state based on the clock pulse applications. The output of the counter can be used to count the number of pulses. Generally, counters consist of a flip-flop arrangement which can be synchronous counter or asynchronous counter. In synchronous counter, only one clock i/p is given to all flip-flops, whereas in asynchronous counter, the o/p of the flip flop is the clock signal from the nearby one. The applications of the microcontroller need counting of exterior events such as exact internal time delay generation and the frequency of the pulse trains. These events are frequently used in digital systems & computers. Both these events can be executed by software techniques, but software loops for counting will not give the exact result slightly more important functions are not done. These problems can be rectified by timers and counters in the microcontrollers which are used as interrupts.";
